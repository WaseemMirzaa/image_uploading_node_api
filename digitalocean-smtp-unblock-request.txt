Subject: Request to Unblock SMTP Ports for Wedding Application Email Service

Hello DigitalOcean Support Team,

I am developing a wedding planning application called "4 Secrets Wedding" and need to send transactional emails to users. Currently, I am unable to send emails via SMTP due to blocked outbound ports on my droplet.

REQUEST DETAILS:
- Droplet IP: 164.92.175.72
- Required Ports: 587 (STARTTLS) and 465 (SSL/TLS)
- Email Provider: GMX SMTP (mail.gmx.net)
- Application Purpose: Wedding planning app for sending invitation emails, collaboration notifications, and access management emails

USE CASE:
My application sends legitimate transactional emails including:
- Wedding checklist collaboration invitations
- Invitation acceptance/decline notifications  
- Access revocation notifications
- User account management emails

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Application: Node.js wedding planning API
- Email Service: GMX SMTP with proper authentication
- Email Volume: Low volume (personal wedding planning use)
- Recipients: Legitimate users who have requested collaboration

BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION:
This is a legitimate wedding planning application that requires email functionality for core features. All emails are transactional and sent only to users who have explicitly requested collaboration on wedding checklists.

I understand DigitalOcean blocks SMTP ports by default to prevent spam, and I confirm that:
- I will only send legitimate transactional emails
- I will not send bulk marketing emails
- I will implement proper email authentication
- I will monitor and prevent any abuse

Could you please unblock outbound SMTP access on ports 587 and 465 for my droplet? This is essential for my application's core functionality.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

BACKUP PLAN WHILE WAITING
================================================================================

While waiting for SMTP unblock, your current email service uses Ethereal Email:
- Provides preview URLs to view email content
- Shows exactly how emails will look when sent
- Allows testing all email functionality
- No actual emails sent to inboxes

Once SMTP is unblocked:
- Update email service to use GMX SMTP
- Real emails will be delivered to Gmail inboxes
- Keep preview functionality for debugging
